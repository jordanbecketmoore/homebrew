						", passive perception 21 Languages Abyssal, Common, Dwarvish, Elvish, Infernal, Orc Challenge 27 (105,000 XP) Aggressive. As a bonus action, Obould can move up to his speed toward a hostile creature he can see. Divine Destroyer. Creatures who aren't deities can't benefit from any resistances or immunities from Obould's attacks, spells, or effects. Gruumsh's Fury. Obould deals two extra dice of damage when he hits with a weapon attack (included in the attack). Innate Spellcasting. Obould's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (save {@dc 23}). He can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components: At will: {@spell detect evil and good}, {@spell dispel magic}, {@spell fireball} 1/day each: {@spell dispel evil and good}, {@spell fire storm}, {@spell teleport} Legendary {@spell Resistance} (3/Day). If Obould fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead. Magic Resistance. Obould has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. Superior Athleticism. Obould has advantage on all ability checks and saving throws involving Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution. In addition, his jump distance is doubled, and he can use the Grapple and Shove actions against creatures of Huge size or smaller. Survivor. Obould regains 20 hit points at the start of his turn, if he has fewer than half hit points. This trait does not function if Obould starts his turn with 0 hit points. Actions Multiattack. Obould uses Demand Obedience and makes two attacks with Ragecinder. He can replace one or both attacks with his Fiery Javelin. Ragecinder (greatsword). Melee Weapon Attack: {@hit 16} to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}22 ({@damage 4d6 + 8}) slashing damage plus 27 ({@damage 6d8}) fire damage. If the target is a creature, Obould can choose one of the following additional effects: Cleave. Obould chooses another creature within 5 feet of the target. If the original attack would have hit the second creature, it takes half the original damage rolled. Distract. The next attack roll against the creature by an attacker other than Obould has advantage if the attack is made before the start of Obould's next turn. Kill. If the target had less than 10 hit points before being hit by this attack, Obould instantly kills the target. Trip. The target must succeed on a {@dc 25} Strength saving throw or be knocked {@condition prone}. Fiery Javelin. Obould conjures a javelin made of flames and hurls it at a creature he can see within 600 feet of him. The javelin strikes unerringly and forces the target to make a {@dc 24} Strength saving throw. On a successful save, the target takes 22 ({@damage 4d6 + 8}) fire damage and the javelin disappears. On a failed save, the target is knocked {@condition prone} and {@condition restrained} as the javelin pierces its body and pins it to the closest solid surface. A pinned creature takes 22 ({@damage 4d6 + 8}) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end these conditions and make the javelin disappear by using its action to make a {@dc 20} Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. Fiery Arena (Recharge 6). Obould creates a magical ring of fire around himself and at least one other creature of his choice. The ring can be up to 30 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. It otherwise functions like the {@spell wall of fire} spell (save {@dc 23}), except Obould doesn't need to concentrate on it and can prematurely dismiss it as a bonus action. Reactions Unyielding. When Obould is subjected to an effect that would move him, knock him {@condition prone}, or both, he is neither moved nor knocked {@condition prone}. Legendary Actions Obould can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature's turn. He regains use of legendary actions at the start of his turn. Attack (Costs 2 Actions). Obould attacks once with Ragecinder. Command Allies. Obould chooses up to three allies he can see within 30 feet of him. If a chosen creature can see or hear Obould, it can make one weapon attack as a reaction, with advantage on the attack roll. Fiery Might (Costs 2 Actions). Obould uses his Fiery Javelin or Fiery Arena action. Frighten Foes (Costs 3 Actions). Obould glares at up to five creatures within 30 feet of him. Each target must succeed on a {@dc 23} Wisdom saving throw or become {@condition frightened} of Obould until the end of Obould's next turn. Any target within 5 feet of Obould has disadvantage on the saving throw. Tactical Repositioning. Obould moves up to his speed without provoking opportunity attacks."
